PUBG NodeJS Radar V2

Notice, this is the clean version of the hack without the cryptocurrency miner, since OP is a piece of shit and uploaded a dirty release.

If you downloaded the old version follow these instructions: https://www.mpgh.net/forum/showthread.php?t=1362234

Hi,
I want to share this Packet Radar with you. It works really well and much better than my last one (Link: https://www.mpgh.net/forum/showthread.php?t=1350723)
It has all the feature as the last one, but it's much cleaner and refresh faster. Not to mention it's SO MUCH easier to install.

Status:
Undetected (4/26/2018)

Feature:
Player Location
Items Location
Care Packages Location
Vehicles Location

Requirement:
A PC (Preferably with two monitors)
WinPcap
A Brain

Steps:
1. Install WinPcap & NodeJS
2. Find out your Local IP (Type ipconfig in cmd and find line with IPv4 Address)
3. Extract the Radar
4. Run "Install.vbs"
5. Open “Start Hack.vbs”
6. Enter Local IP
7. A window (browser) will pop up with Radar
8. Enjoy 
It might not work the first time, try multiple times!!!\
